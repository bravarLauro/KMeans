# K-Means
Dummy K-Means algorithm for 2D points in python. This is just a repository template.

### Description
[K-Means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) is a clustering algorithm. The algorithm partitions a set of **n** points (2D points in this case, e.g. coordinates) into a given number of **k** clusters. Each cluster contains at least one point (unless n > k), and each cluster is defined by a centroid which is the mean of the points belonging to cluster.

### Requirements
pip install requirements.txt

### Example
